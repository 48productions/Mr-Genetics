# Mr-Genetics
 The discord bot to blame when you realize you have terrible genes

 It also allows for discord server members to self-assign roles you configure by reacting to a message the bot sends... how neat is that?

# Command Usage:

**Note: Running any command requires you have the "admin" role! See !setadminrole for details**

## !help
DMs you a brief list of commands and how to use them

## !addrole "Category" "Role" Description
Adds a role to the role list config.
  - Category: The category to put this role under, in quotes. Will be created if it doesn't exist.
  - Role: The role to assign, in quotes. Must be a role that already exists on the server.
  - Description: The role's description (no quotes!), to be displayed on the role list. This is optional.
  
After running this command, a message is sent to confirm the addition. To confirm, react with the emote to associate with the role!

Limitations:
  - The role used for this bot's "admin" commands can't be added to the role list, nor can the server's admin roles
  - Discord limits reactions to 20 per message (afaik). Since one message is used per category in the role list, a category can't have more than 20 roles in it.
  - Any standard (unicode) emoji or any custom emoji *the bot has access to* can be used as a role emote - go wild!
  - Any individual role or emoji can't be added twice in the same category
  - Don't forget, roles in the role list can be gained by ANY server member! Don't add your moderation roles to it!


## !removerole "Category" "Role"
Like addrole, but it uhh, removes roles. Category and Role must be in quotes, like with addrole.

After sending, react to the bot's confirmation message using ‚ùå to confirm removal.

## !rolelist
Sends the "role list" to whatever channel you run this command in.

  - Each category is printed as a message, react with a role's emote to get that role!
  - This bot self-deletes any old role list messages, to prevent user confusion
  - Sending messages/reactions using !rolelist is intentionally slowed to appease the Discord API's rate limits

## !setadminrole "Role"
Sets the "admin" role for this bot to the specified role.

  - If this is set, users without this role can't run ANY bot commands and can only gain roles from reactions.
  - Once set, this restriction can't be removed without editing the config.
  - The bot will send a confirmation message - *Make sure you have this admin role* and confirm by reacting to it with üîí.

## !sortcategory "Category"
Sorts the roles in "Category" by alphabetical order - Perfect for organizing your last-minute role additions!

(By default, roles are displayed on the role list in the order you added them in)


### Other notes
 - This bot doesn't ship with a bot access token (obviously), place yours in `secret-token.txt` in the same folder as `bot.py`!
 - This bot's activity message randomly cycles every 6 hours, customize them via `playing_messages.py`
