 The discord bot to blame when you realize you have terrible genes

 It allows for discord server members to self-assign roles you configure by reacting to a message the bot sends... how neat is that?
 
 It also has a score-tracking leaderboard - Admins can set up a scoreboard for users to submit scores too.


### Other notes
 - This bot doesn't ship with a bot access token (obviously), place yours in `secret-token.txt` in the same folder as `bot.py`!
 - This bot's activity message randomly cycles every 6 hours, customize them via `playing_messages.py`
