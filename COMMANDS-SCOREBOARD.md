## Scoreboard Command Usage

Scoreboards are stored in individual config files under `scoreboards/` - one must be loaded for scoreboards to be functional!

### Field commands

### Score commands

TL;DR: Users submit scores with `!submit`, admins verify them with `!verify`

User-submitted scores are marked as unverified - they show up on the leaderboard with a âš  next to them.

Admins can verify a user-submitted score by running `!verify`.

Running any of these commands will (in the future) prompt the user to react to an emote to choose which field to submit their score under.

 - `!submit (score)` - Submits an unverified score for your username (can be run by non-admins)
 - `!verify <user> (score)` - If `score` is specified, `user`'s score will be set to that score. Otherwise, this command will verify their unverified score (if they have one)
 - `!scremoveentry <user>` - Removes `user`'s score from a field.
